# FRB-RMDM

Initial version of machine readable form of Table B.2 of the paper 
'The dispersion measure and rotation measure from fast radio burst
host galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG50 simulation' (accepted by A&A).

There is an example jupyter notebook of how to create RM and DM PDFs of FRB host galaxies at different redshifts, 
with different stellar mass, star formation activity, galaxy inclination and projected offset of the FRB, based
on TNG50 galaxies (https://www.tng-project.org/data/).
